# GeneratePress Beave Builder Color Palettes

A custom plugin to add Beaver Builder color compatibility for the GeneratePress Global Color Palettes.

Adds the correct prefix '--wp--preset--color--' to the GeneratePress Global Colors so they are usable in Beaver Builder.

You can now set you Global Colors in Generate Press and not have to re-set them up in Beaver Builder using their css variables as well.
